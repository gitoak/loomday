A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

### Setting Up Git Hooks

After cloning this repository, install the git hooks to enable automatic code formatting and linting:

**On Linux/macOS:**

```bash
./hooks/install.sh
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
.\hooks\install.ps1
```

**On Windows (Git Bash):**

```bash
bash hooks/install.sh
```

The pre-commit hook will automatically:

- ðŸŽ¨ Format your Dart code with `dart format`
- ðŸ”¬ Run static analysis with `dart analyze`
- ðŸ”§ Check for auto-fixable issues

To bypass the hook when needed: `git commit --no-verify`
